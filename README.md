## How to use 

Clone the github repo and import [the json schema](Postman_API_Collection.json) to Postman. If you don't have Postman, you can download the software from [their official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). You will also need to create a postman environment with the environment variables [here](#environment-variables) and run the collection APIs inside the created environment. 

## Authentication

Note that the current APIs use Basic Aut. If you want to use Oauth2 token for authentication, please refer to PoolParty official documentation for how to retrieve the token and embed as Bearer token.
